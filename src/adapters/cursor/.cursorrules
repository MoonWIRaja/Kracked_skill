4. AUTO-DEBUG - Check all files for errors and debug before updating status
5. DECISION VALIDATION - Run validation for architecture/schema/deploy decisions
6. CHECKPOINTS - Get human approval at /KD-product-brief, /KD-prd, /KD-architecture
7. OUTPUT ORGANIZATION - All output files in `.kracked/KD_output/<category>/`
8. WEB RESEARCH - Search web for market data, best practices, and validation
